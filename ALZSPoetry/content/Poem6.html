    <!-- Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening by Robert Frost -->
    <span class="line">Whose woods these are I think I know.</span><br/>
    <span class="line">His house is in the village though;</span><br/>
    <span class="line">He will not see me stopping here</span><br/>
    <span class="line">To watch his woods fill up with snow.</span><br/><br/>
    
    <span class="line">My little horse must think it queer</span><br/>
    <span class="line">To stop without a farmhouse near</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Between the woods and frozen lake</span><br/>
    <span class="line">The darkest evening of the year.</span><br/><br/>
    
    <span class="line">He gives his harness bells a shake</span><br/>
    <span class="line">To ask if there is some mistake.</span><br/>
    <span class="line">The only other soundâ€™s the sweep</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Of easy wind and downy flake.</span><br/><br/>
    
    <span class="line">The woods are lovely, dark and deep,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">But I have promises to keep,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">And miles to go before I sleep,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">And miles to go before I sleep.</span><br/><br/>
