      <!--My Shadow by ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON --> 

    <span class="line">I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.</span><br/>
    <span class="line">He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;</span><br/>
    <span class="line">And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.</span><br/></span><br/>


    <span class="line">The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to growâ€”</span><br/> 
    <span class="line">Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;</span><br/> 
    <span class="line">For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,</span><br/> 
    <span class="line">And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.</span><br/> </span><br/>


    <span class="line">He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,</span><br/> 
    <span class="line">And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.</span><br/> 
    <span class="line">He stays so close beside me, he's a coward you can see;</span><br/> 
    <span class="line">I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!</span><br/> </span><br/>


    <span class="line">One morning, very early, before the sun was up,</span><br/> 
    <span class="line">I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;</span><br/>
    <span class="line">But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,</span><br/> 
    <span class="line">Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.</span><br/>
