      <!--Daffodils by William Wordsworth--> 
      
    <span class="line">I wandered lonely as a cloud</span><br/>
    <span class="line">That floats on high o'er vales and hills,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">When all at once I saw a crowd,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">A host, of golden daffodils;</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Beside the lake, beneath the trees,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</span><br/><br/>
    
    <span class="line">Continuous as the stars that shine</span><br/>
    <span class="line">And twinkle on the milky way,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">They stretched in never-ending line</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Along the margin of a bay:</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Ten thousand saw I at a glance,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</span><br/><br/>
    
    <span class="line">The waves beside them danced; but they</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:</span><br/>
    <span class="line">A poet could not but be gay,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">In such a jocund company:</span><br/>
    <span class="line">I gazed—and gazed—but little thought</span><br/>
    <span class="line">What wealth the show to me had brought:</span><br/><br/>
    
    <span class="line">For oft, when on my couch I lie</span><br/>
    <span class="line">In vacant or in pensive mood,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">They flash upon that inward eye</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Which is the bliss of solitude;</span><br/>
    <span class="line">And then my heart with pleasure fills,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">And dances with the daffodils.</span><br/>
