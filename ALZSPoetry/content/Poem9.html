      <!--The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost --> 
      
    <span class="line">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">And sorry I could not travel both</span><br/>
    <span class="line">And be one traveler, long I stood</span><br/>
    <span class="line">And looked down one as far as I could</span><br/>
    <span class="line">To where it bent in the undergrowth;</span><br/></span><br/>

    
    <span class="line">Then took the other, as just as fair,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">And having perhaps the better claim,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Though as for that the passing there</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Had worn them really about the same,</span><br/></span><br/>

    
    <span class="line">And both that morning equally lay</span><br/>
    <span class="line">In leaves no step had trodden black.</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Oh, I kept the first for another day!</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">I doubted if I should ever come back.</span><br/></span><br/>


    <span class="line">I shall be telling this with a sigh</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Somewhere ages and ages hence:</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”</span><br/>
    <span class="line">I took the one less traveled by,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">And that has made all the difference.</span><br/></span><br/>
