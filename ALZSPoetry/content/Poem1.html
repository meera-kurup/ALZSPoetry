      <!-- Trees by Joyce Kilmer--> 
    <span class="line">I think that I shall never see</span><br/>
    <span class="line">A poem lovely as a tree.</span><br/><br/>
    
    <span class="line">A tree whose hungry mouth is prest</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast;</span><br/><br/>
    
    <span class="line">A tree that looks at God all day,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">And lifts her leafy arms to pray;</span><br/><br/>
    
    <span class="line">A tree that may in Summer wear</span><br/>
    <span class="line">A nest of robins in her hair;</span><br/><br/>
    
    <span class="line">Upon whose bosom snow has lain;</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Who intimately lives with rain.</span><br/><br/>
    
    <span class="line">Poems are made by fools like me,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">But only God can make a tree.</span><br/>
