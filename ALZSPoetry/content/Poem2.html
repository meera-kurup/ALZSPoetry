      <span class="line">When you are old and grey and full of sleep,</span><br/>
      <span class="line">And nodding by the fire, take down this book,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">And slowly read, and dream of the soft look</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;</span><br/><br/>

    <span class="line">How many loved your moments of glad grace,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">And loved your beauty with love false or true,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">And loved the sorrows of your changing face;</span><br/><br/>

    <span class="line">And bending down beside the glowing bars,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled</span><br/>
    <span class="line">And paced upon the mountains overhead</span><br/>
    <span class="line">And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.</span><br/>
