      <!--O Captain! My Captain! by Walt Whitman --> 

        <span class="line">O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,</span><br/>
  <span class="line">The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,</span><br/>
  <span class="line">The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,</span><br/>
  <span class="line">While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;</span><br/>
                           <span class="line">But O heart! heart! heart!</span><br/>
                              <span class="line">O the bleeding drops of red,</span><br/>
                                 <span class="line">Where on the deck my Captain lies,</span><br/>
                                    <span class="line">Fallen cold and dead.</span><br/></span><br/>

  <span class="line">O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;</span><br/>
  <span class="line">Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,</span><br/>
  <span class="line">For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,</span><br/>
  <span class="line">For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;</span><br/>
                           <span class="line">Here Captain! dear father!</span><br/>
                            <span class="line">This arm beneath your head!</span><br/>
                                 <span class="line">It is some dream that on the deck,</span><br/>
                                   <span class="line">You’ve fallen cold and dead.</span><br/></span><br/>

  <span class="line">My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,</span><br/>
  <span class="line">My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,</span><br/>
  <span class="line">The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,</span><br/>
  <span class="line">From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;</span><br/>
                           <span class="line">Exult O shores, and ring O bells!</span><br/>
                              <span class="line">But I with mournful tread,</span><br/>
                                 <span class="line">Walk the deck my Captain lies,</span><br/>
                                    <span class="line">Fallen cold and dead.</span><br/></span><br/>
