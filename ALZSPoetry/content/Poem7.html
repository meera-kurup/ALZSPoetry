      <!--The Arrow and the Song by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow-->
      
    <span class="line">I shot an arrow into the air,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">It fell to earth, I knew not where;</span><br/>
    <span class="line">For, so swiftly it flew, the sight</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Could not follow it in its flight.</span><br/><br/>
    
    <span class="line">I breathed a song into the air,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">It fell to earth, I knew not where;</span><br/>
    <span class="line">For who has sight so keen and strong,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">That it can follow the flight of song?</span><br/><br/>
    
    <span class="line">Long, long afterward, in an oak</span><br/>
    <span class="line">I found the arrow, still unbroke;</span><br/>
    <span class="line">And the song, from beginning to end,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">I found again in the heart of a friend.</span><br/>
