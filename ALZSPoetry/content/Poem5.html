      <!-- It Couldn't Be Done by Edgar Albert Guest -->
      
    <span class="line">Somebody said that it couldn’t be done</span><br/>
    <span class="line">But he with a chuckle replied</span><br/>
    <span class="line">That “maybe it couldn’t,” but he would be one</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Who wouldn’t say so till he’d tried.</span><br/>
    <span class="line">So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin</span><br/>
    <span class="line">On his face. If he worried he hid it.</span><br/>
    <span class="line">He started to sing as he tackled the thing</span><br/>
    <span class="line">That couldn’t be done, and he did it!</span><br/><br/>
    
    <span class="line">Somebody scoffed: “Oh, you’ll never do that;</span><br/>
    <span class="line">At least no one ever has done it;”</span><br/>
    <span class="line">But he took off his coat and he took off his hat</span><br/>
    <span class="line">And the first thing we knew he’d begun it.</span><br/>
    <span class="line">With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Without any doubting or quiddit,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">He started to sing as he tackled the thing</span><br/>
    <span class="line">That couldn’t be done, and he did it.</span><br/><br/>
    
    <span class="line">There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">There are thousands to prophesy failure,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">There are thousands to point out to you one by one,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">The dangers that wait to assail you.</span><br/>
    <span class="line">But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Just take off your coat and go to it;</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Just start in to sing as you tackle the thing</span><br/>
    <span class="line">That “cannot be done,” and you’ll do it.</span><br/>
