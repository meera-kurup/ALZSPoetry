      <!-- How Do I Love Thee? by Elizabeth Barrett Browning -->
    <span class="line">How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.</span><br/>
    <span class="line">I love thee to the depth and breadth and height</span><br/>
    <span class="line">My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight</span><br/><br/>
    <span class="line">For the ends of being and ideal grace.</span><br/>
    <span class="line">I love thee to the level of every days</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.</span><br/>
    <span class="line">I love thee freely, as men strive for right.</span><br/><br/>
    <span class="line">I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.</span><br/>
    <span class="line">I love thee with the passion put to use</span><br/>
    <span class="line">In my old griefs, and with my childhoods faith.</span><br/>
    <span class="line">I love thee with a love I seemed to lose</span><br/>
    <span class="line">With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,</span><br/>
    <span class="line">I shall but love thee better after death.</span><br/>
