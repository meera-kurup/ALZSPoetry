# ALZSPoetry

ALZSPoetry is a free application, avaliable in the Apple App Store, designed to help Alzheimer's patients and families. Studies have shown that reciting poetry from childhood would incite old memories and bring happiness to Alzheimer's patients. Using this application, Alzheimer's patients can listen to poetry recited by family members anywhere in the world.

Begin by creating a family account that can be shared between the patient and family members. Once an account is created, family members can poems that can be saved to AWS cloud storage. Then, recordings are available for patients to play.

The app also has an option to record and save poems locally on the device. This option can be used for playback without internet access.

The app was coded in Swift, an iOS programming language, and integrated AWS Cloud storage for account creation and access to poetry audio and data across devices.

(Certain files in the repository are titled ALZ Poetry as that was the previous name of the app, but due to copyright reasons, the app name was changed to ALZSPoetry, although the internal file names might not reflect the change.)
